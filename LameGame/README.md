I finished the program and was able to run it using the command in maven that you have on your site with no errors and all of the functionality that you requested has working code in there and will appear just as you asked when you run it. I did not fully comprehend how to factor in my jUnit testing to maven and once i was done that was just another headache so i didn't upload anything as far as testing goes, it would have been easier for me to have done it without maven and just tested with a main class but i had used your template and had it running so far in maven so i didn't want to switch and not meet the deadline. You have been far too kind on this assignment and i am grateful for everything, next assignment will be better and on time, guaranteed. I understand the code is horrendous, and for that I am sorry. But, it works. I did not use abstract classes or implement an interface here which i should have since that may have made it easier, and i will remember that in the future. I am getting help for the next assignment and from now on so I hope my future code will meet your standards.
