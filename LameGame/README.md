I didn't know why i was supposed to implement an abstract classo rinterface here so i tried simply making it work by hard coding and using packages and importing other files. Given that maven is pretty difficult this was also a struggle for me and I could not make it work in time, as you can see. I should have asked for help sooner but I did not and it showed considering i could barely get basic functions compiling and running in maven.
